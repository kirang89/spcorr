# Introduction to spcorr

A naive port of [Norvig's spell corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)
in Clojure. I wanted to try some exercise in Clojure and decided on implementing
this. It's been a fun learning experience.

To try it out, do:

    $ lein run <misspelled-word>

To run tests, do:

    $ lein test
